# Reconnect-O-Matic-3000
A terminal based implementation of the Minecraft Client created using MCProtocol for the purposes of keeping Chunks Loaded on a server. This script is written to run on a Raspberry Pi to keep chunks loaded for cactus farms / mob grinders. 

Features:
- Keeps chunks loaded so you don't have to. This allows you to generate items from your Farm/Spawner when you're not online.
- Runs on most OS(s) including the Raspberry Pi
- Requires small amount of memory and does not use a GUI.
- Open source (Feel free to reuse and edit)

If using this script please navigate to com.jaken9.reconbot.reconbot.java and enter Username, Password and Server IP values. 

If you decide you’d like this bot to run 24/7 off a Raspberry Pi look into using Linux’s Crontab for the purposes of starting the script on server boot. 
You may also consider rebooting the Raspberry Pi every hour.
